# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 ###
July 21 2019
***Today's Progress***
Started my first personal project (calculator) combining all that I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, JS). Initially had some issues with layout and then JS, but overcame and am extremely pleased to be moving ahead and growing. Will continue completing functionality and adding enhancements in the coming days.

### Day 2 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent about 1 hour doing some updates and adding functionality. Completed "Clear" function, and added functionality for arithmetic operators (+ - * /), also added logic to store 1st value and clear screen after arithmetic button is pressed.

***Thoughts***
Did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked, but made notable progress nonetheless. Struggled with several different additions and overcame - so I am pleased with how the day's work went. Stepping back, I am pleased with the amount of progress I have made and doing this 100 days of coding is really challenging me and forcing me to grow much more than online instruction alone.

### Day 3 ###
***Today's Progress***
Today I finished off basic functionality for all arithmetic functions and the equals function. So now everything is basically functional except for the memory functions (MR, MS, MC) and the decimal point. There is plenty of room for refinement as well as more features to add for more polish - but I could not be happier with the steady progress and participating in this challenge.

***Thoughts***
It definitely takes some adjustment to get used to coding for this challenge on top of coursework, but I see the obvious benefits already and I continue to be pleased with my growth and expanding knowledge. So far coding has been a joyride and now doing this challenge has thrown it into overdrive. I am really immersing myself in coding and learning all sorts of things that will benefit me now as well as down-the-road in my coding career - looking forward to completing this project and then launching into a yet-even-bigger project.

### Day 4 ###
***Today's Progress***
I did get in at least an hours worth of coding today, howevever it was course work instead of personal project work. Will definitely continue tomorrow, as I am absolutely exhausted today.

### Day 5 ###
***Today's Progress***
Added functionality for all memory buttons and decimal point, so now every button works - very cool. There is still a decent amount of polish to add as far as how the output displays and perhaps making the code more efficient - but this is certainly a good working draft of a calculator.

***Thoughts***
Ok I redeemed myself today and got my daily, non-class coding done early. The fact I did not work on my project yesterday, was really stinging me today and I resolved to make the necessary adjustments to ensure I did not repeat that episode. I have learned my lesson about time management and getting my daily coding done as early as possible so that the day doesn't get away from me and I can continue my streak for the 100 days.

### Day 6 ###
***Today's Progress***
My first project is DONE! I fixed functionality for: zero (leading zeroes not allowed), decimal (only single decimal point allowed), and memory recall (can now be used in an arithmetic operation - e.g. 100 + MR = X, previously it only displayed the number stored in memory). 

***Thoughts***
With my first project functional and under my belt, I am quite pleased with how this turned out - especially since when I began, I was skeptical as to whether I could make it work 100% as I had not done anything similar to serve as a guide. Looking back, there has been unquestionable growth by leaps and bounds and I am feeling increasingly confident in my abilities and it is a joy to see all the skills I am learning converge into one project. There were several times where I was stuck or confused or unsure how to implement a feature, but one-by-one, line-by-line I coded my way through all of it and emerged victorious! I am excited to take the next leap and move to my next project - which I am still determining - most likely I will complete and polish a todo app before moving on to a completely novel project.

### Day 7 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent significant time today working on Project #2. Having some initial challenges getting todo items to display on the page using new logic.

***Thoughts***
Making good progress - looking forward to making an appealing, modern todo list with some nice animations/features included. Also looking forward to Project #3 coming up!

### Day 8 ###
***Today's Progress***
Continued progress on Project 2 (todo list) - I've successfully implemented the text input box, add button and functionality and delete functionality. Much of the functionality from my original code is no longer applicable, so I will complete the todo list and integrate the pertinent logic from the original code.

***Thoughts***
From my Zero to Mastery course, I have learned some new techniques to improve functionality of my todo list and have been able to apply them immediately - so it is great to be able to integrate project and coursework in this way to produce a work-product.

### Day 9 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent much of the day working through Free Code Camp final projects to obtain Responsive Web Design Certification.

***Thoughts***
Very pleased to be getting my certification and looking forward to racking up more in the near future.

### Day 10 ###
***Today's Progress***
worked on formatting of todo-list items, and also strike-through feature (on click); however the strike-through is not functioning and requires more troubleshooting - once that is done I should be about done.

***Thoughts***
A little frustrated about strike-through feature not working yet, despite working fine previously, but also still riding high from COMPLETING MY CERTIFICATE :)

### Day 11 ###
***Today's Progress***
Deconflicted bootstrap css with my custom css so that list items can be clicked to complete/strike.

***Thoughts***
Very pleased to have triumphed again after struggling recently with my css not working. It turned out to be bootstrap conflicting with my own css, and i could not find answers anywhere and had to figure it out myself via trial and error. Very happy!

### Day 12 ###
***Today's Progress***
Project #2 completed! I added functionality for all buttons including toggle all and delete all.

***Thoughts***
There is always more to be added and refined, but all the essential functionality is working and error-free as far as I can tell so I am pleased with the project and looking forward to tackling the next project... #3!

### Day 13 ###
***Today's Progress***
In between projects so I worked on FreeCodeCamp today, reverse string function.

***Thoughts***
I know the logic that is needed but am having issues with scope. Sigh, pretty deflated feeling after a string of successes - but I suppose that is just how it goes, and I will pick it up again tomorrow.

### Day 14 ###
***Today's Progress***
My group project has yet to begin, so I made the best use of time and spent most of the weekend (about 5+ hours per day) coding and working through my coursework.

***Thoughts***
Feeling excellent about all the progress made as I have been relatively stagnant the last two weeks.

### Day 15 ###
***Today's Progress***
My group project has yet to begin, so I made the best use of time and spent most of the weekend (about 5+ hours per day) coding and working through my coursework.

***Thoughts***
Uncovered an opportunity/potential project to help a family friend with a website that could really use some help and I feel I know enough to be able to make some major improvements and that feels great - my first potential REAL project that will count toward "professional" experience and one that people will actually visit/use - so looking forward to that.

### Day 16 ###
***Today's Progress***
New project slated to start this weekend, so I have been working diligently to code and learn more advanced tools and techniques to get ready for what I hope to be my first major Portfolio entry with an eye on future job-hunting. I had some struggles today after deciding to convert my workstation (laptop) from Windows 10 to Linux Ubuntu. I wound up accidently destroying my Windows partitions and had to go full Linux, leaving everything I had done up to this point (in windows) behind. 

***Thoughts***
It was a bit sad to lose my Windows environment and the setup I had grown accustomed to as I learned about development, however I realize that Linux is the future and where I need to be immersing myself so it is for the better.

### Day 17 ###
***Today's Progress***
New project slated to start this weekend, so I have been working diligently to code and learn more advanced tools and techniques to get ready for what I hope to be my first major Portfolio entry with an eye on future job-hunting. In particular I began learning about NPM, node.js, Package.JSON, downloaded react.js and learned to integrate all of these plus browserify into an existing project. Got my Linux up and running good with the essential files and tools I need installed and working fine.

***Thoughts***
I am quite tired it is almost 11pm, looking forward to continuing my development and getting ready for my big project!

### Day 18-27 ###

***Today's Progress***
Had a stretch where I continued coding, but did not log it. I have been progressing nicely through my Z2M Course and learning a lot about React and coding my second app now. Have also learned some about Node  NPM and backend. I also had some property damage and had to have some emergency repairs done so I also was offline for a couple days as well. So here I am getting back on track.

### Day 28 ###
August 17 2019
***Today's Progress***
Had an rocking day coding React, working on my newest solo project: Starwars Explorer using SWAPI . I basically started yesterday with mapping out some basic functionality, and today I worked on my components props states and the interconnection of the three throughout the app. 

***Thoughts***
I could not be more excited about a project and see plenty opportunity to really shine and showcase my skills to now, so I am highly motivated. This experience is really akin to Neo hyper-learning his training programs - I am reflecting on the daily deluge of new tools, JS versions, libraries, API's, HTML/CSS syntax, JSON it goes on and on. Although I am learning at a good pace and absorbing much, I am increasingly noticing some topics that require further review or set aside for another time as I push to learn Full Stack JS. This React API app is really forcing me to absorb and intimately understand exactly what is going on in React and how it functions.. a lot of "aha" moments going off, so that is really what it is all about and excited to continue working my app. FInally on that note, I plan to see if i can debug existing, otherwise I will start out from scratch with a new build (1000% up-to-date) and build (and test) one basic feature after another versus adding too many before testing; lesson learned.

### Day 29 ###
August 18 2019
***Today's Progress***
All out today working on my personal project. I was able to make some progress with importing the data and determining root cause. Once I get the data fetching and manipulation down and have it flow through React the way I intend, it should be smooth sailing to add layout/css.

***Thoughts***
Man I am pooped, still very much encouraged, but exhausted after a busy weekend. I know that I am learning an awful lot, and letting it sink in. On the flip-side I am learning alot by failing constantly and trying to determine what's not working and why. I am also beginning to feel and understand the life of a programmer; hacking away to get it to work - and then - "Eureka!"

### Day 30 ###
August 19 2019
***Today's Progress***
Another hard day's work on my React app. Successfully got local data to upload and display, and very close to getting API data to work as well.

***Thoughts***
Wow.. Day 30! It has been a real brawl learning React, but I can proudly report I am having fun in the midst of struggling, and had a big moment once I got data import to work. I really cannot wait to get API's working so then I can progress toward the UI/UX design.

### Day 31 ###
August 20 2019
***Today's Progress***
Great day for progress.. got my Character component working with fetched API data and passed via props.

***Thoughts***
It was such a triumphant moment when the name field populated with "Luke Skywalker". FINALLLLYYYYYY - that only took forever, learned a lot about how React and imports work, and what doesn't work, learned a ton of that. I can't explain how many times I re-compiled the app thinking "it's gonna work *this* time" only to eventually be greeted by a screen full of red errors and failure... The original way I learned to do this, was not at all working this time around, and for various reasons. This is tremendous experience and I know I will get better and faster and learn to write more efficiently - but I am really liking this journey I am on and recognize I am making steady progress climbing up this massive mountain... there is so much up ahead of me, but also, a growing amount of things *behind* me.

### Day 32 ###
August 21 2019
***Today's Progress***
Big day for progress, rocking right along: successfully added all 5 components with API imports working (non-nested).

***Thoughts***
Wow I could not be happier, I first struggled after adding all the new code at once and THEN testing (oops). Luckily the issue was simply how I set my variable to this.state.etcetera when I have just used this.state and now it works. It was an absolute delight to test after my fix and see everything populated for the first time - it was a beautiful sight - that's what it's all about! Hoping to get much done while off on vacation next week and try to finish this up and ship!

### Day 33 ###
August 22 2019
***Today's Progress***
Whew I am on a roll. Got my "dissapear" offscreen feature working @ lunch and just now completed adding states/variables to make the buttons control which component is viewable. cool!
***Thoughts***
I am just so pleased, not only in the features and the steady progress, but also how well this seems to be going for a first app, and finally because of the apparent success of a new strategy that is emerging.. For now I call it "brute force coding" just muscling my way through to get full functionality and then worrying about css, refinement and re-factoring later. At times I am embarassed thinking I don't want anyone to see this early code because of how ineligant or crude it is but no matter - I am getting the job done and learning along the way, and feel nothing can stop me! It is truly a great time and a good feeling and I absolutely can imagine (enthusiastically) doing this for a living!!

### Day 34-38 ###
August 27 2019
***Today's Progress***
This past few days have been phenomenal - busier than usual, but managed to progress my app to being nearly done. Most of the logic/functionality etc is done and mostly just a few touches and polish, aesthetic changes are all that is left before it is ready to be shared/shipped.
***Thoughts***
It has been a hard slog but just looking at where I was days ago to where I am now, what I've learned, the app and its features and added polish - this has been an outstanding learning experience - I am feeling much more comfortable with React now and ready to learn how Redux fits into the picture. I've decided to tweak a few more things and then consider this completed as far as working React API App. I would like to add more features and polish down the road if there is time, but there is so much more to learn and I can't spend too much time on this project right now much as I may like to.
