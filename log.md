# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 ###
July 21 2019
***Today's Progress***
Started my first personal project (calculator) combining all that I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, JS). Initially had some issues with layout and then JS, but overcame and am extremely pleased to be moving ahead and growing. Will continue completing functionality and adding enhancements in the coming days.

### Day 2 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent about 1 hour doing some updates and adding functionality. Completed "Clear" function, and added functionality for arithmetic operators (+ - * /), also added logic to store 1st value and clear screen after arithmetic button is pressed.

***Thoughts***
Did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked, but made notable progress nonetheless. Struggled with several different additions and overcame - so I am pleased with how the day's work went. Stepping back, I am pleased with the amount of progress I have made and doing this 100 days of coding is really challenging me and forcing me to grow much more than online instruction alone.

### Day 3 ###
***Today's Progress***
Today I finished off basic functionality for all arithmetic functions and the equals function. So now everything is basically functional except for the memory functions (MR, MS, MC) and the decimal point. There is plenty of room for refinement as well as more features to add for more polish - but I could not be happier with the steady progress and participating in this challenge.

***Thoughts***
It definitely takes some adjustment to get used to coding for this challenge on top of coursework, but I see the obvious benefits already and I continue to be pleased with my growth and expanding knowledge. So far coding has been a joyride and now doing this challenge has thrown it into overdrive. I am really immersing myself in coding and learning all sorts of things that will benefit me now as well as down-the-road in my coding career - looking forward to completing this project and then launching into a yet-even-bigger project.

### Day 4 ###
***Today's Progress***
I did get in at least an hours worth of coding today, howevever it was course work instead of personal project work. Will definitely continue tomorrow, as I am absolutely exhausted today.

### Day 5 ###
***Today's Progress***
Added functionality for all memory buttons and decimal point, so now every button works - very cool. There is still a decent amount of polish to add as far as how the output displays and perhaps making the code more efficient - but this is certainly a good working draft of a calculator.

***Thoughts***
Ok I redeemed myself today and got my daily, non-class coding done early. The fact I did not work on my project yesterday, was really stinging me today and I resolved to make the necessary adjustments to ensure I did not repeat that episode. I have learned my lesson about time management and getting my daily coding done as early as possible so that the day doesn't get away from me and I can continue my streak for the 100 days.

### Day 6 ###
***Today's Progress***
My first project is DONE! I fixed functionality for: zero (leading zeroes not allowed), decimal (only single decimal point allowed), and memory recall (can now be used in an arithmetic operation - e.g. 100 + MR = X, previously it only displayed the number stored in memory). 

***Thoughts***
With my first project functional and under my belt, I am quite pleased with how this turned out - especially since when I began, I was skeptical as to whether I could make it work 100% as I had not done anything similar to serve as a guide. Looking back, there has been unquestionable growth by leaps and bounds and I am feeling increasingly confident in my abilities and it is a joy to see all the skills I am learning converge into one project. There were several times where I was stuck or confused or unsure how to implement a feature, but one-by-one, line-by-line I coded my way through all of it and emerged victorious! I am excited to take the next leap and move to my next project - which I am still determining - most likely I will complete and polish a todo app before moving on to a completely novel project.

### Day 7 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent significant time today working on Project #2. Having some initial challenges getting todo items to display on the page using new logic.

***Thoughts***
Making good progress - looking forward to making an appealing, modern todo list with some nice animations/features included. Also looking forward to Project #3 coming up!

### Day 8 ###
***Today's Progress***
Continued progress on Project 2 (todo list) - I've successfully implemented the text input box, add button and functionality and delete functionality. Much of the functionality from my original code is no longer applicable, so I will complete the todo list and integrate the pertinent logic from the original code.

***Thoughts***
From my Zero to Mastery course, I have learned some new techniques to improve functionality of my todo list and have been able to apply them immediately - so it is great to be able to integrate project and coursework in this way to produce a work-product.

### Day 9 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent much of the day working through Free Code Camp final projects to obtain Responsive Web Design Certification.

***Thoughts***
Very pleased to be getting my certification and looking forward to racking up more in the near future.

### Day 10 ###
***Today's Progress***
worked on formatting of todo-list items, and also strike-through feature (on click); however the strike-through is not functioning and requires more troubleshooting - once that is done I should be about done.

***Thoughts***
A little frustrated about strike-through feature not working yet, despite working fine previously, but also still riding high from COMPLETING MY CERTIFICATE :)

### Day 11 ###
***Today's Progress***
Deconflicted bootstrap css with my custom css so that list items can be clicked to complete/strike.

***Thoughts***
Very pleased to have triumphed again after struggling recently with my css not working. It turned out to be bootstrap conflicting with my own css, and i could not find answers anywhere and had to figure it out myself via trial and error. Very happy!
