# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 ###
July 21 2019
***Today's Progress***
Started my first personal project (calculator) combining all that I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, JS). Initially had some issues with layout and then JS, but overcame and am extremely pleased to be moving ahead and growing. Will continue completing functionality and adding enhancements in the coming days.

### Day 2 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent about 1 hour doing some updates and adding functionality. Completed "Clear" function, and added functionality for arithmetic operators (+ - * /), also added logic to store 1st value and clear screen after arithmetic button is pressed.

***Thoughts***
Did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked, but made notable progress nonetheless. Struggled with several different additions and overcame - so I am pleased with how the day's work went. Stepping back, I am pleased with the amount of progress I have made and doing this 100 days of coding is really challenging me and forcing me to grow much more than online instruction alone.

### Day 3 ###
***Today's Progress***
Today I finished off basic functionality for all arithmetic functions and the equals function. So now everything is basically functional except for the memory functions (MR, MS, MC) and the decimal point. There is plenty of room for refinement as well as more features to add for more polish - but I could not be happier with the steady progress and participating in this challenge.

***Thoughts***
It definitely takes some adjustment to get used to coding for this challenge on top of coursework, but I see the obvious benefits already and I continue to be pleased with my growth and expanding knowledge. So far coding has been a joyride and now doing this challenge has thrown it into overdrive. I am really immersing myself in coding and learning all sorts of things that will benefit me now as well as down-the-road in my coding career - looking forward to completing this project and then launching into a yet-even-bigger project.
