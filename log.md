# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 ###
***Today's Progress***
Started my first personal project (calculator) combining all that I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, JS). Initially had some issues with layout and then JS, but overcame and am extremely pleased to be moving ahead and growing. Will continue completing functionality and adding enhancements in the coming days.
