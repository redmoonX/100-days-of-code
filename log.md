# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 ###
***Today's Progress***
Started my first personal project (calculator) combining all that I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, JS). Initially had some issues with layout and then JS, but overcame and am extremely pleased to be moving ahead and growing. Will continue completing functionality and adding enhancements in the coming days.

### Day 2 ###
***Today's Progress***
Spent about 1 hour doing some updates and adding functionality. Completed "Clear" function, and added functionality for arithmetic operators (+ - * /), also added logic to store 1st value and clear screen after arithmetic button is pressed.

***Thoughts***
Did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked, but made notable progress nonetheless. Struggled with several different additions and overcame - so I am pleased with how the day's work went. Stepping back, I am pleased with the amount of progress I have made and doing this 100 days of coding is really challenging me and forcing me to grow much more than online instruction alone.
